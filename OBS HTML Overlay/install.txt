So now i have the solution. I made the last Days a Full HTML Animated-Banner.

This little Steps are very Important:
1. Make sure u have the Latest Update on your OBS Studio
2. Make sure u have the OBS Plugin "Browser Source"
3. Download the ZIP-Archiv from Github
4. Put the Folder where ever u want
5. Now u can open the "main.html" and change what u want (U need an Editor -> My Tipp: Notepad++)
6. After that, go in your OBS and add BrowserSource to your Scene
7. Delete all on the CSS Window
8. Click on the Point "Local File"
9. Than Search your "main.html" File and Click "OK"
10. Than click on the bottom the Button "Refresh cache" and your Done

Thats it! :)
Now u have your own Animated HTML Banner in OBS.
